      <h1>Background</h1>
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The space elevator is a sci-fi favorite, a planet-to-space transport system of enormous capacity and efficiency, not to mention an architectural wonder.</p>
      <p>Our earliest records of the idea date back to 1895 and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, the Russia rocket scientist and space philosopher. The concept has appeared in numerous fictional works even Hollywood movies across the decades.</p>
      <p>The space elevator was the stuff of dreams. Until recently...</p>
      <h2>Feasibility</h2>
      <p>Dr. Bradley Edwards was the lead scientist on a number of feasibility studies for the space elevator concept, including the 2003 study commissioned by the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/index.html" target="_blank">NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts</a>, and in his words, <q>There is no reason we can't build one today. We simply need the will to do it.</q></p>
      <p>The surprising truth is the technological gaps that exists in the past are all covered, and have been for some time now.
      <ul>
        <li>We have more than three times the needed tensile strength in current <a href="carbon-nanotubes.html">carbon nanotubes</a>.</li>
        <li>We can build fast and efficient space elevator climber vehicles.</li>
        <li>We can structure the space elevator in order to evade space debris.</li>
        <li>We can power the climbers and achieve better efficiency than any rockets.</li>
        <li>Once a first space elevator ribbon is set, we can rapidly deploy more.</li>
        <li>The structure can be built to fail safely even in the event of a catastrophy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Furthermore, <a href="technology.html">technologies</a> are rapidly improving on all fronts. It is only a matter of time before humanity builds the first space elevator. The race has already begun.</p>
      <h2>Benefits</h2>
      <p>The benefits could scarcely be overstated.</p>
      <p>For those of us that look up to the stars and dream, who work in the space industry already, who hope someday to visit space and look back on our beautiful blue planet... The space elevator accelerates everything.</p>
      <p>Rockets cost a tremendous amount, because they incur exponential costs to go to space. They have to carry fuel, to carry the fuel, to carry the fuel, to carry the payload to space. If our gravity were much higher, rockets wouldn't even be physically capable of going to space. The space elevator changes the equation.</p>
      <p>For the space elevator, the cost of moving a load to space is the cost of the energy to move the payload. You don't have to take fuel with you, or expend fuel to carry to fuel, to carry the fuel, et cetera. This 90% or greater reduction in the cost of getting to geostationary orbit brings a world of possibilities.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>There are only a handful of space-fairing nations. A space elevator could make space radically more accessible.</li>
        <li>With a space elevator, we can explore new energy generation systems (gather solar energy in space and beam it back down to Earth).</li>
        <li>Asteroid mining is still alarmingly costly and risky. Space elevators could make asteroid mining a feasible endeavor by reducing the cost of experimentation.</li>
        <li>A variety of scientific studies can go to space, as costs are ushered lower by space elevators.</li>
        <li>Space hotels, space manufacturing, and a class of new space businesses could become realities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In Dr. Bradley's words, <q>When historians look back 500 years from now, they will put a breaking point right where we build the space elevator.</q></p>

<!-- <h2>Summary</h2> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch has been established to build and operate the first space elevator. Our team will consist of global leaders in all aspects of the space elevator and corporate partners that are at the forefront in each subsystem. Our reviewed engineering design work and commercial technologies will enable us to promptly begin construction of the space elevator. The cost is $8B and begin profitable launches in 2029. Operational costs will allow us to launch a one kilogram payload to space for the same cost as sending a one kilogram package by FedEx from Stockholm to Copenhagen. Our customers will be nations wanting a space program, energy companies, mining companies, tourist agencies, private space companies, universities, schools and individuals. By 2030 Longbranch will generate $3B in profit from launches and another $1B from carbon nanotube production. However, Longbranch is more than just a company. By providing a “vertical railroad” to space, Longbranch will influence who develops space and how it might be done. This will allow Longbranch to leverage its services to become equity partners in many space activities for additional passive income.</p> -->
<!-- <h2>About Longbranch</h2> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch is a team of world-class scientists, engineers, business people and corporate partners assembled specifically to build the space elevator.</p> -->
<!-- <p>The engineering for the space elevator is well understood by the Longbranch team. Over the last 20 years, we have developed the subcomponent designs, produced the required carbon nanotubes and compiled the commercially available subsystems. The next stage is to complete detailed engineering designs, work with partners to build the subcomponents and begin component testing.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Historically, the question mark in construction of the space elevator is the availability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Over the last eight years our team has built a proprietary production system that has demonstrated mass production of carbon nanotubes with strengths of 150GPa (60GPa is required to build the space elevator, carbon fiber is 7 GPa, steel is 5 GPa). System modifications are needed to extend the CNT length from 5mm to 20mm for spinning but these modifications are straight forward. CNTs and CNT-based ribbon will be produced in Longbranch facilities with the excess being sold as an independent product. The remaining space elevator components are available from commercial vendors.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Once constructed, the space elevator will effectively be a vertical railroad with payloads carried up the ribbon by climbers. The energy, organizational, hardware, and operations cost for this ascent is a small fraction of the costs for a rocket and results in our operational costs being 1/10 those of any rocket launch system(Ariane, ULA, SpaceX). Our launch costs will be low risk and cost $250/kg verses more than $3000/kg for other launchers. Our cost also does not increase for solar system destinations such as the Moon, Mars and the asteroids. Our launch is still $250/kg whereas other launchers increase in expense to hundreds of thousands of dollars per kilogram.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch with its unique service of inexpensive, safe access to space will have a global impact on the space industry, high-strength materials and general international activities. We will be the only realistic provider of access to space for</p> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>construction of solar power satellites to provide clean, inexpensive energy to Earth,</li> -->
<!--   <li>school engineering programs,</li> -->
<!--   <li>individuals,</li> -->
<!--   <li>large-scale science programs.</li> -->
<!--   <li>Asteroid mining,</li> -->
<!--   <li>immediate colonization of Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and asteroids.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- <p>Part of our corporate strategy is also to negotiate equity stakes in all space activities. This will provide a long-term passive income stream that will grow over time.</p> -->
