      <h1>Carbon Nanotubes</h1>
      <p>Carbon is an incredible element. It can take on numerous chemical configurations, including some we might recognize like coal and diamonds. It is particularly interesting as we assess the materials needed to erect a space elevator. The key is tensile strength.</p>
      <h2>Enabling The Space Elevator</h2>
      <p>The space elevator idea has two major conceptions.</p>
      <p>In the earliest writings, philosophers and scientists thought of building a structure tall enough to reach space. This concept breaks down even before leaving the drawing board.</p>
      <p>The other approach is to hold a space elevator in tension between the Earth and a counterweight object of sufficent mass beyond geostationary orbit, much like the way you might swing a rope around in a circle. The centrifugal force holds the rope extended from your arm. In the same way, a counterweight <q>swung</q> by the Earth with a space elevator ribbon attached can be held in tension.</p>
      <p>This tension is extraordinary, and it requires an extraordinary material to handle it.</p>
      <p>That's where our nanotube friends come in.</p>
      <h2>An Impressive Material</h2>
      <p>Carbon nanotubes are microscopic tubes, like tiny straws, made from hexagonally patterned carbon atoms. They have incredible tensile strength. Theoretically, they can reach 100 to 200 gigapascals of tensile strength. In practice we're finding ___, which is more than ___ times what we need for the space elevator.</p>
      <p>Carbon nanotubes were the missing key to make the space elevator feasible, and now they're ready for action.</p>

<!-- <h2>Summary</h2> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch has been established to build and operate the first space elevator. Our team will consist of global leaders in all aspects of the space elevator and corporate partners that are at the forefront in each subsystem. Our reviewed engineering design work and commercial technologies will enable us to promptly begin construction of the space elevator. The cost is $8B and begin profitable launches in 2029. Operational costs will allow us to launch a one kilogram payload to space for the same cost as sending a one kilogram package by FedEx from Stockholm to Copenhagen. Our customers will be nations wanting a space program, energy companies, mining companies, tourist agencies, private space companies, universities, schools and individuals. By 2030 Longbranch will generate $3B in profit from launches and another $1B from carbon nanotube production. However, Longbranch is more than just a company. By providing a “vertical railroad” to space, Longbranch will influence who develops space and how it might be done. This will allow Longbranch to leverage its services to become equity partners in many space activities for additional passive income.</p> -->
<!-- <h2>About Longbranch</h2> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch is a team of world-class scientists, engineers, business people and corporate partners assembled specifically to build the space elevator.</p> -->
<!-- <p>The engineering for the space elevator is well understood by the Longbranch team. Over the last 20 years, we have developed the subcomponent designs, produced the required carbon nanotubes and compiled the commercially available subsystems. The next stage is to complete detailed engineering designs, work with partners to build the subcomponents and begin component testing.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Historically, the question mark in construction of the space elevator is the availability of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Over the last eight years our team has built a proprietary production system that has demonstrated mass production of carbon nanotubes with strengths of 150GPa (60GPa is required to build the space elevator, carbon fiber is 7 GPa, steel is 5 GPa). System modifications are needed to extend the CNT length from 5mm to 20mm for spinning but these modifications are straight forward. CNTs and CNT-based ribbon will be produced in Longbranch facilities with the excess being sold as an independent product. The remaining space elevator components are available from commercial vendors.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Once constructed, the space elevator will effectively be a vertical railroad with payloads carried up the ribbon by climbers. The energy, organizational, hardware, and operations cost for this ascent is a small fraction of the costs for a rocket and results in our operational costs being 1/10 those of any rocket launch system(Ariane, ULA, SpaceX). Our launch costs will be low risk and cost $250/kg verses more than $3000/kg for other launchers. Our cost also does not increase for solar system destinations such as the Moon, Mars and the asteroids. Our launch is still $250/kg whereas other launchers increase in expense to hundreds of thousands of dollars per kilogram.</p> -->
<!-- <p>Longbranch with its unique service of inexpensive, safe access to space will have a global impact on the space industry, high-strength materials and general international activities. We will be the only realistic provider of access to space for</p> -->
<!-- <ul> -->
<!--   <li>construction of solar power satellites to provide clean, inexpensive energy to Earth,</li> -->
<!--   <li>school engineering programs,</li> -->
<!--   <li>individuals,</li> -->
<!--   <li>large-scale science programs.</li> -->
<!--   <li>Asteroid mining,</li> -->
<!--   <li>immediate colonization of Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and asteroids.</li> -->
<!-- </ul> -->
<!-- <p>Part of our corporate strategy is also to negotiate equity stakes in all space activities. This will provide a long-term passive income stream that will grow over time.</p> -->
